# Air quality for The Things Network
A public collaboration project to build a low cost, reliable and capable air quality device for the things network.

This project is being run by the Norfolk TTN group. All are welcome to participate and benefit from the project.

<b>Project objectives</b>

1. Design hardware, software and enclousre for a low cost outdoor air quality device which meets defined requirements for accuracy and reliability.
2. Test devices to a professional level so they can be safely placed in public locations.
3. Publish all data as an open data set and public dashboard to assist the local population in understanding air quality
4. Collaborate with local organisations, such as schools, colleages, universities and commercial businesses to help educate and facilitate air quality understanding.

<b>Current hardware being targetted</b>
1. ATMega2560 Pro - Microcontroller board that provides the required number of hardware serial ports. Provides 5v and 3.3v regulated supply
2. Plantowers PMS5003 - air particle sensor shown to be reliably calibrated from factory and reliable in operation. Requires 5v supply.
3. RN2483a - LoRaWAN radio from Microchip. Although an older radio chip it is well known and provides additional capabilities like battery level monitoring. Requires 3.3v
4. BME280 - a cheap atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity sensor. Requires 3.3v.
5. Safe enclosure. <TO DO> This is by far the biggest challenge for an outdoor, public space sensor. Suggestions welcome.
